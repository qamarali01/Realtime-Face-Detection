# Realtime-Face-Detection


Implemented a real-time face detection model using VGG-16 convolutional neural network architecture. Leveraged transfer learning to fine-tune pre-trained weights. 		
This model can also be trained to identify licence plates


Tech: Python, TensorFlow, Scikitlearn, Huggingface Transformer (VGG-16)
