Real-time Face Detection

This project implements a real-time face detection model using the VGG-16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The model leverages transfer learning by fine-tuning pre-trained weights from VGG-16, making it efficient for detecting faces in real time. Additionally, the model is flexible enough to be trained for other tasks, such as detecting license plates.

Features

	•	Real-time Face Detection: Detects faces in real-time using a live camera feed or video input.
	•	Transfer Learning: Uses VGG-16 pre-trained weights to reduce training time and improve accuracy.
	•	Flexible for License Plate Detection: Can be extended to detect other objects, such as license plates, by retraining the model.
	•	OpenCV Integration: Utilizes OpenCV for capturing video frames and displaying detection results.

Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

	•	Python 3.x
	•	TensorFlow
	•	Keras
	•	OpenCV
	•	NumPy
	•	Matplotlib
	•	Jupyter Notebook (if running the project from a notebook)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python numpy matplotlib



Model Architecture

The face detection model uses the VGG-16 architecture, which is a 16-layer deep CNN. The model has been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and then fine-tuned to detect faces. Transfer learning is utilized to quickly adapt the model to the face detection task.

Usage

	1.	Live Face Detection:
The model can detect faces in real-time using your webcam. Make sure to run the model in an environment where OpenCV can access the webcam. The detection results will be displayed in a separate window showing the bounding boxes around detected faces.
	2.	Training for License Plate Detection:
The model can be trained for other tasks such as license plate detection. You can modify the dataset and adjust the training loop in the provided code to fine-tune the model for detecting license plates or other objects.


 Output

The model detects faces in real-time, drawing bounding boxes around each detected face:
